# Virtual Pet

This project is part of coursework for Manchester Codes Software Engineer FastTrack - Programming Fundamentals (Object Orientated Programming).

## The pet I'm going to make will have the following features:

- You can give them a name
- They can get older
- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit
- You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️
- You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕
- You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking
- If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀
- If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
